## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK 8** or later
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in

## Appendix A : User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have)  - `* *`,  Low (unlikely to have) - `*`


Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...
-------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-----------
`* * *` | new user | see usage instructions | refer to instructions when I forget how to use the App
`* * *` | user | add a new person |
`* * *` | user | delete a person | remove entries that I no longer need
`* * *` | user | find a person by name | locate details of persons without having to go through the entire list
`* * *` | user | update a person's details | keep an updated address book when my contacts change their contact details
`* *` | user | hide [private contact details](#private-contact-detail) by default | minimize chance of someone else seeing them by accident
`*` | user with many persons in the address book | sort persons by name | locate a person easily
`*` | user | export contacts into a readable file | update contacts into phone or email if needed

## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `AddressBook` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

#### Use case: Rename Tag

**MSS**

1. User requests to rename tag, typing in an existing tag and the new tag.
2. AddressBook asks user to confirm the change.
3. User confirms change.
4. AddressBook updates the corresponding tag.
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

1a. Tag does not exist.

> AddressBook shows an error and prints list of existing tags.

1b. The given new tag already exists.

> 1b1. AddressBook sends a notice that new tag is the same as an existing tag.<br>
  Use case resumes at step 2
  
#### Use case: Delete person

**MSS**

1. User requests to list persons
2. AddressBook shows a list of persons
3. User requests to delete a specific person in the list
4. AddressBook deletes the person <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The list is empty

> Use case ends

3a. The given index is invalid

> 3a1. AddressBook shows an error message <br>
  Use case resumes at step 2

## Appendix C : Non Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any [mainstream OS](#mainstream-os) as long as it has Java 8 or higher installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons.
3. Should come with automated unit tests and open source code.
4. Should favor DOS style commands over Unix-style commands.
